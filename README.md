In software testing, [`test automation`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation) is the use of special software (separate from the software being tested) to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes. Test automation can automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place, or perform additional testing that would be difficult to do manually. Test automation is critical for continuous delivery and continuous testing.

Requirements:
=============

* BASIC CODING EXPERIENCE NEEDED  
* Join our open source community with code templates, functions and examples for various types of testing  
* Windows/MAC laptop  
* git, python 3.7+, pycharm, docker, jenkins, qaviton, web-app, mobile-app, desktop-app.  
  All the required installations are covered & documented.  

Course Objectives:  
==================
This course introduces core test automation principles, tools, frameworks & Strategies for variant testing types and delivery needs.
Students will solve problems, explore real-world automation challenges, and create practical and contemporary testing applications.  
  
Specific topic coverage:  
* Environment installation
